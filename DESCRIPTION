Title: Control Number of OpenBLAS Threads
Version: 0.1-0
Description: A micro-package for controlling the number of threads used by
    OpenBLAS from R. This can be useful if you did not set the 'OMP_NUM_THREADS'
    environment variable before starting your R session. Obviously this requires
    that you are using the OpenBLAS library with R.
